<h2> JavaScript란 무엇인가? </h2>
<p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language that follows the ECMAScript standard.
 It was originally designed as a scripting language for websites but
became widely adopted as a general-purpose programming language, 
and is currently the most popular programming language in use.
[1] JavaScript is usually found running in a web browser as interactive or automated content,
ranging from popup messages and live clocks to large web applications.
JavaScript is also commonly used in server-side programming through platforms like Node.js,
[2] or "embedded" in non-JavaScript applications where the base programming language lacks
 the high-level functionality that JavaScript offers.
